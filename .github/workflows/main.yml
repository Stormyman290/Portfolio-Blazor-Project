    # publishes Blazor project to the release-folder
    - name: Publish .NET Core Project
      run: dotnet publish CHBlazorPortfolioTake3.csproj -c Release -o release --nologo
      # -c (--configuration) argument tells to build the project using the Release configuration.
      # -o (--output) argument specifies where to put the published files. Tells dotnet to publish the project to the release folder.
      # --nologo argument will prevent some unnecessary lines from being output to the console.
    # This makes it easy to publish static files to GitHub Pages

      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        BRANCH: gh-pages
        FOLDER: release/wwwroot
        # ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} resolves to a token used for securely communicating with GitHub on your behalf. This token is available by default in all workflows and permissions are limited to the repository that contains your workflow. By passing it into the GITHUB_TOKEN property, the action can use it to create and push to the 'gh-pages' branch.
        # The BRANCH property will configure which branch the action will create and push to. Set this to 'gh-pages'.
        # The FOLDER property will configure which folder and files will be pushed to the 'gh-pages' branch. Set this to 'release/wwwroot'. This is where the project will be published, and all the static resources are in the wwwroot-subfolder.
